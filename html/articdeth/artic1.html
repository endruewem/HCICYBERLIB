                <h1 class="article-title">E-commerce platform breach exposes nearly 34 million customers data</h1>
                
                <p>South Koreas largest online retailer, Coupang, has apologised for a massive data breach potentially involving nearly 34 million local customer accounts.</p>

<p>The countrys internet authority said that it is investigating the breach and that details from the millions of accounts have likely been exposed.</p>

<p>The e-commerce platform is often described as South Koreas equivalent of Amazon.com. The breach marks the latest in a series of data leaks at major firms in the country, including its telecommunications giant, SK Telecom.</p>

<p>Coupang told the BBC it became aware of the unauthorised access of personal data of about 4,500 customer accounts on 18 November and immediately reported it to the authorities.</p>


<p>But later checks found that some 33.7 million customer accounts - all in South Korea - were likely exposed, said Coupang, adding that the breach is believed to have begun as early as June through a server based overseas.</p>

<p>The exposed data is limited to name, email address, phone number, shipping address and some order histories, Coupang said.</p>

<p>No credit card information or login credentials were leaked. Those details remain securely protected and no action is required from Coupang users at this point, the firm added.</p>

<p>The number of accounts affected by the incident represents more than half of South Koreas roughly-52 million population.</p>

<p>Coupang, which is founded in South Korea and headquartered in the US, said recently that it had nearly 25 million active users.</p>

<p>Coupang apologised to its customers and warned them to stay alert to scams impersonating the company.

The firm did not give details on who is behind the breach.</p>

<p>South Korean media outlets reported on Sunday that a former Coupang employee from China was suspected of being behind the breach.</p>

<p>The authorities are assessing the scale of the breach as well as whether Coupang had broken any data protection safety rules, South Koreas Ministry of Science and ICT said in a statement.</p>

<p>"As the breach involves the contact details and addresses of a large number of citizens, the Commission plans to conduct a swift investigation and impose strict sanctions if it finds a violation of the duty to implement safety measures under the Protection Act."</p>

<p>Coupang has faced multiple cyber-security breaches in recent years, including one incident that exposed 460,000 customers data.</p>

<p>Major South Korean organisations have delivered harsh criticism over the latest breach.</p>

<p>The editorial board of local newspaper Chosun Ilbo described the incident as "preposterous" and called for strong sanctions on firms responsible for leaks of its customer data.</p>

<p>Another local media outlet, the Dong-A Ilbo, said the breach is "the worst personal data leak" in Korean history.</p>

<p>The media outlet questioned how long the incident went unnoticed, adding that it "means their internal data protection system barely mattered."</p>

<p>The breach marks the latest in a series of cyber-security incidents affecting major South Korean companies this year, despite the countrys reputation for stringent data privacy rules.</p>

<p>SK Telecom, South Koreas largest mobile operator, was fined nearly $100m (£76m) over a data breach involving more than 20 million subscribers.</p>

<p>In September, Lotte Card also said the data of nearly three million customers was leaked after a cyber-attack on the credit card firm.</p>
